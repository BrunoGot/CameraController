This is a little Server-Client setup embedded in a Arduino gyrometer and connected to Houdini :) This allow you to controll camera or any object position/mouvement by mouving the device
This was a proof of concept realized to present it for my graduation school. 
Todo : 
 - Restructure the code for a more robust/easy to maintain architecture
 - Improve server connection and error handling
 - Smooth incoming data red by the arduino to avoid glitch
 - set up an easy to use workflow and link the incomming datas with any object
 - record movement to apply it on any houdini channel and do a mouvement library


Videos of the tools are comming soon
